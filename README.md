# C---Project2_Nana-Kofi-Djan-Obed-Boakye-Yiadom
 
To run this project, you must create a local project and pull all the files in this repository to it.
You will then have to only run the main file.

The project includes a 'test.txt' file which would take the start and end locations in the form "City, Country"
This test file will be read, so it can be edited to view the information of a different combination of start and end locations.
The output file will be written to a folder called "cmake-build-debug". All output files will be unique and based on the start and stop locations.
